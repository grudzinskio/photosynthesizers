# HacksGiving 2025
Thank you for participating in the HacksGiving 2025 competition!
In collaboriation with MSOE and the Milwaukee Domes Alliance, AI-Club is hoping to provide an opportunity for our talented students to gain more hands-on AI experience for the chance to compete in a $6000, 3-day hackathon -- as well as build solutions that ultimately help a non-profit organization that traditionally is unable to invest into AI solutions!

For more information about what an appropriate solution looks like, as well as important dates, please refer to the [Hacksgiving 2025 Hackathon Rubric](https://msoe365.sharepoint.com/:w:/s/MSOEAI/EWieBmmsRr9BuM91iywVTTIBMr5M9ipwXy8F2m_zf7GDag?e=TL2ATX)
